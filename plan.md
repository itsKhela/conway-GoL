# Planning Conway Game of Life App

## Model

The model is composed by a list of boolean values, wich can be true or false,
depending if the cell at that position is alive or not.
The cells, are considered to be in a certain cordinates of the grid
(x,y) so we can acces to the neighbors of it.

## Update

The desired actions for our app, are to get the next state of the board.
It is also desired to implement a play/pause button.

## View

The logical sections of our app are:

* Main View
  * Button section
  * Grid section
